# 732A81 Project: Comparative Analysis of DistilBERT and Traditional Classifiers for Multi-Class News Classification
This repository contains the implementation of a text classification project comparing traditional machine learning methods (Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression) with advanced pre-trained models, specifically DistilBERT. The project uses the AG News dataset and explores the performance of these models under varying dataset sizes and configurations.

* model_400 contains the model with training sample size 400
